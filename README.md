# pk12_Animal_Aerodynamics
How can nature influence the way we design aircraft? In this module, students will explore the creation of aircraft inspired by animals. Participants will learn about various types of biomimicry techniques employed by engineers and then devise models of their own using paper and other crafting materials to see how they fly. Additionally, students will build an apparatus to test their designs and gain further understanding about aerodynamics and the ways that we can continue to improve the efficiency of air travel.
